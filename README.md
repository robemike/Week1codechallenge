## Description
This is a directory holding three files which each contain a single solution to three problems;
The first problem: Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade
The second problem: Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. 
The third problem: Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
